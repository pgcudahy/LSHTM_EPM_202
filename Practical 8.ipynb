For example we know the odds ratio in hookworm infected compared to uninfected women is 2.95 in the <25 years age group but what is it in the 25+ age group? To determine this we must multiply the appropriate coefficients from the model. This particular estimate corresponds to the comparison [D vs B]. Age is the same in both of these strata therefore we do not need to include a main effect for age. We are comparing hookworm infection vs “no infection” so we do require the main effect of hookworm. Both exposures are \n",

The simpler model (the proportional odds model, since it assumes the odds of severe anaemia are the same regardless of the categories of the other exposure) gives the overall age effect as OR = 0.70. On the other hand the interaction model gives the stratum-specific (i.e. hookworm infection-specific) age effects as OR = 0.75 for hookworm uninfected and OR = 0.66 for hookworm infected women. \n",

    "Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The formal test for interaction suggested very little evidence against the null hypothesis, however the actual stratum-specific estimates are somewhat \n",
    "different to each other. It is important to take away from this that the size of the p-value for the test for interaction does not indicate the magnitude of the interaction effect. \n",
    "2. The overall effect lies somewhere between the two stratum-specific effects; it is essentially a weighted average of the two. \n",
    "3. While the two stratum specific odds ratios appear somewhat different, they both point in the same direction (i.e. are <1).  \n",
    "4. Also, we have not calculated confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals overlap, or include the other stratum specific value, we might reconsider how different we feel the two stratum specific values are.  \n",
    "5. Both the model with and without interaction estimates the underlying ‘true’ effects in the population, and there is no strong evidence that one model is better than the other.  \n",
    "6. Generally speaking, the stronger the evidence of interaction, the more helpful it is to present stratum-specific estimates rather than an overall estimate of effect. However, there is no absolute cut-off, and it is up to us to decide when the interaction is so important to your main question of interest that you cannot present an overall estimate of effect. We cover these choices in more detail in Session SM12 – Strategies of Analysis. \n",
