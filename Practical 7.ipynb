The OR estimates for age without adjusting for hookworm infection were 0.59, 0.42 and 0.48, so again there is a slight difference in the estimates after controlling for hookworm infection.   In the crude (unadjusted) analysis, hookworm infection is a risk factor for severe anaemia and older age is protective against severe anaemia (or in other words, younger age is a risk factor for severe anaemia). The estimated association between hookworm infection and severe anaemia decreases when controlled for age group.  Similarly, the estimated effects of the two older age group get weaker (closer to 1) when controlled for hookworm infection."
